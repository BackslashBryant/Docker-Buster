product_name: "Docker Buster"
vision: |
  A portable desktop/web tool that ingests a Docker image, auto‑generates a signed SBOM, runs CVE & license scans, evaluates config/secrets hygiene, and outputs a tamper‑evident PDF+JSON report with an overall risk score and prioritized fixes—no CI/CD integration required.
personas:
  - Solo DevSecOps engineer validating third‑party containers.
  - Security auditor needing offline evidence.
epics:
  - SBOM Generation
  - Vulnerability & License Scan
  - Risk Scoring Engine
  - Report Builder (PDF + JSON + signature)
  - Simple React/Tailwind UI
features:
  SBOM Generation:
    F1: Support local images (syft -o cyclonedx-json).
  Vulnerability & License Scan:
    F2: Critical & High CVE listing via grype.
    F3: SPDX license detection.
  Risk Scoring:
    F4: Weighted score algorithm (CVE severity, secrets presence).
  Report Builder:
    F5: Combine SBOM + scan into HTML → PDF (WeasyPrint).
    F6: SHA‑256 manifest + detached signature.
  UI:
    F7: Image name input + progress bar + download link.
non_functional:
  - Runs offline on Windows/macOS/Linux.
  - Completes full analysis < 90 seconds on 2‑vCPU laptop.
  - Report bundle ≤ 10 MB.
acceptance_tests:
  - Given a known vulnerable image, report lists CVE‑2021‑44228.
  - Generated PDF checksum matches manifest signature.
  - Secrets detector flags “AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY” in env vars.
out_of_scope:
  - CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, GitLab).
  - Kubernetes cluster scanning.
