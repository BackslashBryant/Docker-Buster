# Decision: Stability Improvements

- **Context**: The application currently has issues with WeasyPrint warnings in logs and 500 errors during report generation.

  1. Implement environment variables to suppress irrelevant warnings
  2. Add comprehensive error handling in report generation
  3. Improve startup scripts for better cross-platform support

- **Consequences**: Cleaner logs, better user experience, more reliable operation.
