      - Global panic button (not started)
      - Accessibility pass (not started)

  phase_4:
    name: Alpha Feedback
    status: not started
    tasks:
      - Preview build (not started)
      - Internal user invite (not started)
      - Feedback collection (not started)

  phase_5:
    name: Enrichment
    status: not started
    tasks:
      - Nango OAuth sync (not started)
      - Spotify/YouTube interest mapping (not started)

    status: not started
    tasks:
      - Supabase realtime radar (not started)
      - Redis / RLS optimization (not started)
      - RevenueCat skeleton (not started)

logical_dependency_chain:
  - Phase 1 must complete to bootstrap system and Supabase
  - Phase 2 provides all core interaction loops
  - Phase 3 is mandatory for MVP safety release
  - Phase 4 enables real-world validation
  - Phase 5 is optional UX enrichment
  - Phase 6 prepares for open beta and growth

risks_and_mitigations:
  - Risk: Feature creep during onboarding
    mitigation: Lock to 3 screens max before radar
  - Risk: OAuth setup delays
    mitigation: Use Nango with fallback scopes
  - Risk: Realtime issues under load
    mitigation: Mock radar for MVP; add Supabase Channels post-beta
  - Risk: PII leakage
    mitigation: No real names, no location stored, enforce RLS
