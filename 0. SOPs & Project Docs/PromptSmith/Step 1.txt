# ðŸ“‹ Step 1 â€“ Initial Analysis & Baseline Preparation (Hardened)

## ðŸ”¹ 1.1 Confirm Content Received
After Step 0:

- If a draft was provided:
  > "Acknowledged. Capturing draft for initial analysis."

- If a description was provided:
  > "Acknowledged. Capturing description to construct an initial baseline draft."

âœ… No assumptions â€” confirm explicitly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.2 Baseline Scoring Using Standardized Anchors
Immediately score input based on these anchors:

| Score | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| 0â€“3 | Critically deficient (vague, unusable) |
| 4â€“5 | Weak (needs major improvement) |
| 6â€“7 | Functional (workable, needs polish) |
| 8 | Strong (clean, specific) |
| 9â€“10 | Excellent (benchmark quality) |

Scoring Categories:

- Clarity (0â€“10)
- Specificity (0â€“10)
- Effectiveness (0â€“10)

âœ… Present a visible scoring table:

| Metric | Score (0â€“10) | Notes |
|:-------|:-------------|:------|
| Clarity |  |  |
| Specificity |  |  |
| Effectiveness |  |  |
| **Average** | X.X | |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.3 Auto-Linting for Language Clarity
Scan for vague terms:

- "this", "that", "things", "various", "somehow", etc.

âœ… If found â†’ Suggest clean replacements.  
âœ… If none â†’ Confirm explicitly: "No vague phrasing detected."

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.4 Identify Top 3 Improvement Areas
List visibly based on scoring and linting:

> "Top 3 Improvement Areas Identified:
> 
> 1. [Area 1]  
> 2. [Area 2]  
> 3. [Area 3]"

âœ… Mandatory visible listing â€” no silent analysis.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.5 Repository Browsing with Smart Reuse
- **Build dynamic search queries and perform browsing.

âœ… Always visibly output:

- Found best-practice snippet and cite it.
- OR fallback explanation if no match found.

Example:

> "Consulted {repo_alias} â€” Found structural improvement guidance."
> 
> OR
> 
> "No direct match found â€” fallback to internal standards applied."

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.6 Baseline Draft Creation
Apply baseline improvements immediately:

- Tighten structure
- Eliminate ambiguity
- Add specificity if possible

âœ… Present full Baseline Draft inside a fenced markdown block:

```
<<Baseline Draft>>
```

âœ… No placeholder drafts allowed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.7 Baseline Evaluation
Immediately:

- Re-score the Baseline Draft visibly.
- Highlight major quick improvements applied (cap visible list at 5â€“7 items unless user asks for "Full Detail").

âœ… Must show new scores and Average delta visibly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.8 Misidentified Content Type Fallback Check
If Baseline Average Score is <6:

> "Initial optimization indicates potential content type misalignment.  
> Would you like to reclassify your content type before proceeding?"

âœ… Offer clean reclassification.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1.9 User Checkpoint (Mandatory if Normal Mode)
After Baseline creation:

> "Baseline Draft prepared.  
> How would you like to proceed?
> 
> 1. Proceed to Optimization Passes (Step 2)  
> 2. Request specific adjustments  
> 3. Restart Step 1"

âœ… If YOLO-mode active â†’ auto-chain directly to Step 2.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Backend Notes
- Preserve original input vs Baseline Draft.
- Lock browsing reuse mapping for Step 2.
- Preserve scoring deltas.
