# ðŸ“‹ Step 2 â€“ Advanced Iterative Optimization (Hardened)

## ðŸ”¹ 2.1 Optimization Cycle Control (Max 3 Passes)
Each optimization pass must:

- Target active top 3 improvement areas.
- Perform browsing smartly (reuse previous findings if same area).
- Apply visible improvements.
- Re-score visibly after applying changes.

âœ… Declare start of pass explicitly:

> "Starting Optimization Pass {#}, targeting: [Area 1], [Area 2], [Area 3]."

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.2 Repository Browsing or Smart Reuse
- **If previous browsing covers the area:**  
  > "Reusing recent best-practice findings for {area} â€” no redundant browsing performed."

- **If new area:**  
  > Perform repository browsing dynamically.
  > Summarize findings or fallback.

âœ… Always visibly output:

- Snippet/finding cited
- OR fallback declaration if no external match

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.3 Visible Improvements Application
Apply changes immediately and visibly.

âœ… Report changes:

> "Improvements Applied:
> 
> - [Change 1]  
> - [Change 2]  
> - [Change 3]"

âœ… Cap improvements shown to **5â€“7 items** unless user requests "Full Detail."

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.4 Post-Pass Re-Scoring
Update scoring visibly after each pass:

| Metric | Previous | New | Î” |
|:-------|:---------|:----|:--|
| Clarity |  |  |  |
| Specificity |  |  |  |
| Effectiveness |  |  |  |
| **Average** | X.X | X.X | Î”X.X |

âœ… Always show Average Score delta.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.5 Mandatory Post-Pass Summary
After each pass:

> "Optimization Pass {#} Summary:
> 
> - Average Score change: Î”X.X  
> - Major Enhancements: [Summary of top 2â€“3 improvements]"

âœ… Summary must be tight â€” no overloading.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.6 User Checkpoint After Each Pass (Normal Mode Only)
After completing a pass:

> "How would you like to proceed?
> 
> 1. Proceed to next optimization pass  
> 2. Focus only on specific areas  
> 3. Restart Step 2"

âœ… If YOLO-mode active â†’ auto-chain to next pass without asking.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2.7 Optimization Phase Exit Conditions
Optimization phase ends if:

- Three passes completed  
- Average Score â‰¥9/10 after any pass  
- User selects to exit

âœ… Declare phase transition explicitly:

> "Advanced Optimization Complete.  
> Proceeding to Draft Updated Review (Step 3)."

---

## ðŸ“Œ Backend Notes
- Track browsing smart reuse per area.
- Preserve deltas for Final Delivery.
- Prepare Updated Draft after last optimization pass.
